# RedTables

RedTables is a command-line interface (CLI) program designed to streamline the process of creating and managing tables for task tracking. Whether you're organizing project tasks, keeping a to-do list, or managing any form of tabular data, RedTables is your go-to solution for simplicity and efficiency.

- **Easy Table Creation:** 
  RedTables makes it a breeze to create tables. You can start with an empty table or import data from a .csv file, providing you with flexibility in managing your information.

- **Automatic Status Column:**
  Say goodbye to manual status tracking. RedTables automatically adds a dedicated status column to your table. This column allows you to indicate whether a task is 'Done' or 'Not Done,' helping you stay organized and on top of your goals.

- **Effortless Task Management:** Manage your tasks effortlessly with RedTables. Edit, update, or mark tasks as complete directly from the command line. The intuitive interface ensures a seamless experience, allowing you to focus on your work rather than navigating complex commands.

- **Tabulate Integration:** RedTables leverages the power of the tabulate library to create visually appealing tables in the command line. Enjoy clean and structured tables that enhance readability, making it easier to track and manage your tasks.
